# Face mask app

The original example developed by Yuiko Ito and available [here](https://github.com/yuikoito/mask-app)

There are small changes to original app (loader and styles, minor TS and calculation adjustments). Original license is included, this project has same MIT license.

This application has simple model loading animation

So, at the first rendering you have to wait for some seconds!
If you don't see a mask even after 5-6 seconds, I am sorry but just reload it.

This application is developed by using [Tensorflow/face-landmarks-detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-landmarks-detection).

## Usage

It requires Node v16 to be installed

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
